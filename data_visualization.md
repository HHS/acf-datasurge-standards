# Data Visualization Standards

Data visualization is a powerful tool for communicating complex information clearly and efficiently. By transforming data into graphical formats, it enables viewers to grasp difficult concepts and identify trends, patterns, and outliers quickly. Effective data visualizations can enhance decision-making, simplify the presentation of research and analysis, and make data more accessible to a broader audience. Following standards for data visualization ensures consistency, accuracy, and integrity, making it easier for audiences to understand and engage with the data, regardless of their expertise level.

### Understand Your Audience

-   Tailor visualizations to the knowledge level and needs of your audience. Customize the complexity of your visualizations to match the familiarity and expertise of your audience with the subject matter.

-   Use appropriate terminology and complexity. Avoid technical jargon for general audiences and ensure that any necessary terms are clearly defined.

-   Ensure the data presented is directly relevant to the interests and concerns of your audience. Irrelevant data can distract or disengage viewers, so focus on what matters most to them.

### Choose the Right Visualization

-   Match the visualization type to your data and the story you want to tell. For example, use bar charts for comparisons among categories, line graphs for showing trends over time, and scatter plots to reveal correlations between variables.

-   Avoid using overly complex or unconventional chart types that might confuse the audience. While innovative charts can be engaging, they may require more effort for the audience to understand, potentially obscuring the data's message.

-   When the platform allows, consider adding interactive elements like tooltips, filters, or drill-downs. These can offer additional layers of detail for interested users without overwhelming the primary view.

-   Use pie charts carefully. While pie charts are popular for showing parts of a whole, they can be misleading or hard to interpret if there are too many slices or if the differences between slices are subtle. Reserve pie charts for datasets with a limited number of categories where the proportions between them are clear and significant.

### Use Color Effectively

-   Utilize established color palettes. ACF has a specific color palette for visuals available through the [ACF Digital Toolbox](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/digital-toolbox).

-   Avoid using red and green together. This color combination can be problematic for color-blind viewers. Opt for color-blind friendly palettes that ensure your visualizations are accessible to a broader audience.

-   Employ contrasting colors to draw attention to important points or outliers in your data. This can help guide the viewer's eye to the most crucial parts of your visualization.

-   Ensure that your visualization includes a clear and accessible legend or labeling system that explains what each color represents, making the visualization easy to understand even for those seeing it for the first time.

### Always contextualize your graphs

-   Link to relevant background documents and PRs in published research and dashboards. This allows viewers to explore the data's source, methodology, and additional information for a deeper understanding.

-   Clearly state any assumptions made during data collection, analysis, or visualization. This transparency helps viewers better interpret the data and understand its potential limitations.

-   Explain what the graphs are meant to show. Don't assume the viewer will immediately grasp the purpose of the graph.

-   Unless the meaning is evident from the graph's title, always label your axes. This includes units of measurement and any necessary contextual information to understand the scale or range of the data.

-   Include captions on graphs. Captions should describe what the chart shows and the main takeaway. This is particularly important for accessibility, allowing those who cannot see the graph to still understand its key message.

### Pay Attention to the Details

-   Sort graphs by a meaningful dimension. For instance, sorting bar charts by value can make it easier to see the largest and smallest categories at a glance, or arranging time series data chronologically can help illustrate trends over time more clearly.

-   Specify decimal accuracy. Be mindful of the decimal places you use; too many can clutter your graph and confuse the viewer, while too few can mislead by oversimplifying.

-   Use comma separators for large numbers. Using commas to separate thousands, millions, and beyond can greatly enhance readability, making it easier for viewers to quickly understand the scale of the data.

-   Start axes at zero where appropriate to avoid misleading representations.

### Limit visual distractions

-   Use clean backgrounds. Opt for simple, uncluttered backgrounds that don't interfere with the readability of the data. Complex textures or images behind data visualizations can make them harder to read and understand.

-   Use clearly-labeled legends when appropriate. Legends are crucial for helping viewers decipher what different colors, shapes, or sizes represent in your visualization. Make sure they are concise, clearly labeled, and positioned so as not to obstruct the data.

-   In interactive dashboards, make sure folks can't accidentally mis-aggregate by disabling drill-downs when not applicable.
